        <p style="color:#787878"><i>“The English language is like London: proudly barbaric yet deeply civilised, too, common yet royal, vulgar yet processional, sacred yet profane. Each sentence we produce, whether we know it or not, is a mongrel mouthful of Chaucerian, Shakespearean, Miltonic, Johnsonian, Dickensian and American. Military, naval, legal, corporate, criminal, jazz, rap and ghetto discourses are mingled at every turn. The French language, like Paris, has attempted, through its Academy, to retain its purity, to fight the advancing tides of Franglais and international prefabrication. English, by comparison, is a shameless whore.”

Languages are powerful tools that we have to utilise in our daily lives. Without them, we would not be able to communicate with each other easily. Learning spoken English is important because of the fundamental requirements of modern work life, and its usefulness in connecting diversified cultures, therefore Hong Kong should devote more time on spoken English learning.</b></font>

            <font face="Arial"><b>Learning spoken English can help people in seeking better job opportunities. English is the most widely spoken language and is an efficient mode of communication in the business world. We are living in a global business community where people are connected rapidly and internationally as a result of substantial trading (“Bitesize”, 2014). Knowing how to exchange information in English is vital when we wish to trade with several countries. Most companies operate internationally and require spoken English especially in Hong Kong where it is an international city with a culturally diverse population. As a case in point, interviewees will be asked to speak in English during an interview to show that they are competent to communicate in an additional language. If they are non-native English speakers, they should try to use correct English sentence structure and tenses in a conversation causing interviewers to appreciate their English speaking skills. Therefore, we must be proficient at communicating in English in order to function in this environment.</b></font>

        <p style="color:#1589FF">
            <font face="Arial"><b>Having the ability to speak in English is also a benefit in connecting with people of a variety of cultures. Although the majority of people speak in their own language in their native countries, they are often able to communicate in English with others. English is the world lingua franca, a language used as a common language between speakers whose native languages are distinct (Lingua franca, 2017). It has become the third most spoken language in the world according to <a href="https://www.accreditedlanguage.com/2016/09/09/the-10-most-common-languages/">Accredited Language Services</a> (2016). This indicates that cultural exchange is a major advantage of gaining fluency in speaking English. It would make travelling more accessible, as we can communicate with a large proportion of people through learning only one language. Living in an unfamiliar country provides international visitors an opportunity to get to learn about a new environment in order to understand one another better. People will benefit from a more open mind once they have learnt to speak English as they can talk to people of other nationalities confidently (L, 2016). By communicating with them, they will be able to perceive more about the local society and their surroundings in order to connect with different people of various cultures.</b></font>

            <font face="Arial"><b>English not only gives us access to other cultures, it is also a repository of history and culture from across the globe. From the fifth century to the middle of the eleventh century, Old English was being spoken and written in Britain which was similar to the Germanic mother tongue of the Anglo-Saxons at a time where people could hardly understand a word in a text. With the development of English, it eventually transformed into the language of Shakespeare (Mabillard, 2000). The evolution of the English language has become part of our history and culture having been used for centuries spread across the world, including to Hong Kong. It is tremendously consequential that we should preserve the English language as a depository of art consisting of poetry and literature that are still valuable around the world. Imagine if we lose the most prominent language in the world, we would have lost the history and culture as well as information that is being recorded about new discoveries of animals which would otherwise be extinct and the significance of scientific research would be disappeared. This could mean that if English language vanishes in this world, knowledge would have been gone and we would not be able to receive those information that we obtain.</b></font>

        <p style="color:#1589FF">
            <font face="Arial"><b>However, many people neglect English language as it is unnecessary for them to speak the language in their country. Specifically in Hong Kong where plenty of mainlanders come here for holidays every year, locals tend to speak in Cantonese and Mandarin when they work with mainlanders. In addition, mandarin is the most spoken language in the world based on SpeakLike Native (Vašková & Kotala, 2016). Eventually, they would avoid communicating in English since it is not necessary for them. Consequently, there will be more competition between English and Mandarin. Moreover, technologies are being developed more rapidly and translation is being used more often. People do not have the motivation and become lazier in learning to speak English. Instead, they can easily translate their own language into English by using Google translate. As a result, their English starts to deteriorate.</b></font>

        <p style="color:#1589FF">
            <font face="Arial"><b>To conclude, learning spoken English is important because of the necessity of employment, and the interconnection between a mixture of countries. It is necessary that we act against the competition of mandarin and the influence of technology in order to preserve English.</b></font>
