        <p style="color:#1589FF"><b>’<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JebwYGn5Z3E">13 Reasons why</a>’ talks about Hannah Baker, a girl who committed suicide, just because she is being bullied. Before she actually killed herself, she recorded 13 tapes why she killed herself. She also talked about how she actually got hurt physically and mentally because she is raped and bullied. The feeling when she actually cannot talk to anyone because she considers everyone besides her as enemies. The only person that she can talk about is her teacher. She cannot talk to her parents because she doesn’t want them to know how she’s being bullied. She doesn’t have friends to talk to anymore because they’re all bad people. But why is she the only one who is bullied? Why not Justin? Or Jessica? Or Tyler. This might be the fate, or she did something that makes everyone hates her that they all bullied her. The story doesn’t quite mention about it but problems have to be solved. Her so-called ‘friends’ have to do something to fix this but it’s already too late. They want to amend what they did to her, to make things better..it’s already too late. She went home, goes to bathroom, takes out the razor and goes to the bathtub. She slit her wrist and bled to death.</b></p>

Clay is an example who actually loves her but he didn’t say to her that he loved her when she’s actually alive. Things cant be changed when it’s too late. The fact that there are bunch of people who are bullied in our society has many reasons. Some of them might have problems at home that can directly affect their mind physically or verbally. Most of the time, however, students get bullied at school by acting out to get noticed than behaving themselves decently. All these reasons can lead to depression. </b></p>

            In order to prevent bullying, a campaign or charity should be set up 
            to help students understand better about bullying. Teachers can talk about what that is and how to stand up to it safely. In addition, encouragement is important. Students are encouraged to do what they love to do. They, for example, can take part in all sorts of activities to meet more new friends to help build confidence and friendship to prevent them from bullying. </b></p></font>
