<h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<font size=4>
    <p style="color:#1589FF">
        <font face="Arial"><b>Artificial Intelligence can be separated into two different words: 'Artificial' and 'Intelligence'. The word 'artificial' is quite self-explanatory. It is something that human creates. 'Intelligence' means the ability to learn or understand or to deal with new or trying situations. Therefore, the whole term can be defined as a machine with the ability to solve problems that are usually done by humans with our natural intelligence. The idea of artificial intelligence was finalised by the father of AI, John McCarthy, in the late 1950s. In the early 1950s, an English computer scientist who named Alan Turing proposed the Turing Test as a measure of machine intelligence. But what does this have to do with AI? </b></font>

    <h2>The Turing Test</h2>
    <p style="color:#1589FF">
        <font face="Arial"><b>First, let me give you an explanation what Turing Test actually is. <a href="http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/users/reingold/courses/ai/turing.html">Turing Test</a> was developed by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alan-Turing">Alan Turing</a>, an English mathematician, in 1950. It was an experiment decided to test whether a computer had the ability to think like a human being. Turing proposed that a computer could be said to possess artificial intelligence if it could imitate human responses under a particular situation. The test was originally referred to as 'the imitation game' which required three terminals where a device was operated by a computer and two were operated by humans. </b></font></p>

<font size=4>
    <p style="color:#1589FF">
        <font face="Arial"><b>During the test, one human was the questioner while the second human and the computer were the respondents. The respondents were interrogated about a certain area of subjects, using a specific format and context. After asking a number of questions, the questioner was asked to determine which respondent was human and which was a computer. The test was continuously repeated in order to create a fair test. If the questioner makes the correct determination in more than half of the questions, then the computer is considered to have an artificial intelligence. After all, Alan Turing wanted to see if the computer actually did have AI. </b></font>
    </p>
</font>

<font size=4>
    <p style="color:#1589FF">
        <font face="Arial"><b>For years, however, the Turing Test had been widely criticized. The question to whether or not a computer can pass a Turing Test had become irrelevant. They should be focusing on making a human-machine interaction by using a conversional interface. The robot Sophia, for instance, is a social humanoid robot developed by Hong Kong based company called <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/david_hanson_robots_that_relate_to_you">Hanson Robotics</a>. <a href="http://sophiabot.com">Sophia</a> was activated on April 19,2015 and is able to start a natural conversation easily without having any technological issues. She can even act like a normal human by showing more than 60 different facial expressions, track and recognise faces. By creating a robot, they can be able to serve humans and take our jobs productively. To give you a clearer understanding of what AI is, here are a few examples: computer vision, machine learning, natural language processing and knowledge management. </b></font>

    <h2>Two types of AI</h2>
<font size=4>
    <p style="color:#1589FF">
        <font face="Arial"><b>Artificial Intelligence can be categorised into two different Intelligence. They are <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~arihuang/academic/research/strongai3.html">strong AI</a> or Artificial General Intelligence and <a href="http://www.units.miamioh.edu/psybersite/cyberspace/ai/weak.shtml">weak AI</a> or it can refer to as Artificial Narrow Intelligence. Strong AI is equivalent to human intelligence which can mimic the human brain by doing all sorts of activities that we can all do by creating a scientist being. Weak AI is a system that behaves like a human but does not give us an insight into how the brain works. To give you a quick example, computer chess uses AI to predict a million of moves before making the actual moves. Very intelligent, isn't? Deep learning has a similar system as it also mimics the human brain by using neural networks but it does not follow exactly the function. The system uses nodes that act as artificial neurons to connect information. To be more precise, deep learning is a branch of machine learning. But what is machine learning?</b></font>
    </p>
</font>
<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
<font size=4>
    <p style="color:#1589FF">
        <font face="Arial"><b><a href="http://www.expertsystem.com/machine-learning-definition/">Machine Learning</a> is the based idea of Artificial Intelligence. It uses algorithms to get trained data set and learn to predict the upcoming events in the future. Let's say a programmer wants to create a program that can recognise a dog but he has not an idea how. Instead, he can do so with a form of intelligence that can learn to do it. If he gives the program sufficient image data in the form of dogs and let it processes and learn and when you give the program an image of a new dog that it has never seen before, it would be relatively easy to tell that is a dog. </b></font>

<font size=4>
    <p style="color:#1589FF">
        <font face="Arial"><b>People may not realise but we are all using AI in our daily routine. Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant are examples of artificial intelligence and these might affect our everyday lives. When we see music recommendations on Spotify and film suggestion on Netflix, there is a highly complex algorithm behind the program which teaches itself for many years. That is why the system can predict what we want and what to buy before we know ourselves. </b></font>
    </p>
</font>


<font face="Arial">
    <p style="color:#787878"><i><font size=4>"I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I were to guess like what our biggest existential threat is, it's probably that. So we need to be very careful with the artificial intelligence. Increasingly scientists think there should be some regulatory oversight maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don't do something very foolish. With artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon. In all those stories where there's the guy with the pentagram and the holy water, it's like yeah he's sure he can control the demon. Didn't work out. "-Elon Musk</font></i></p></font>


<font size=4>
    <p style="color:#1589FF">
        <font face="Arial"><b>Because of well-developed technologies, we are warned that AI could be the most dangerous thing ever we create. In fact, AI will become more intelligent than the entire human race. As a result, our human brain will become more limited every day and eventually we do not have to make decision because the system has already foretold for us. Is this good or bad? You can all decide yourselves.</b></font>
