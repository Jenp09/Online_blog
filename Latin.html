            <font size=15><b>I'</b></font><b><font size=4>ve always wanted to learn Latin since I was in the UK, and the reason for that is that it can solve a plethora of linguistic problems. To give you a quick example, lots of English words are actually derived from Latin that we don’t even know because we dont think it’s important to explore the origin of a word in details unless you’re a linguist and are interested in its origin, like me.The noun 'village' is a good example which was originated from Latin. If you look closely, the word 'villa' is a Latin word which means house. Therefore, 'village' means a group of houses and assoicated buildings which are situated in a rural area. </font></b></p>

            <font face="Arial"><b>Nassim Taleb, an ex-trader and a philosopher, said, “ The best way to learn a language may be an episode of jail in the foreign country.” For me, this is only true when the language is still commonly spoken. Spanish, for example, is the second most widely spoken language in the world that we should learn as a second language. But some languages are just so rare to speak that we don’t even use them today. Like Latin, for instance, is a dead language. If we date back to 100 BC and 100AD, most people spoke Vulgar Latin as their first language which was the nonstandard form of Latin. As time went by, languages started to change and Latin began to decline. People, at some stage, started to speak English in some countries as it’s easier to understand. So I guess English is a transformation of the Latin language.</b></font>

        <p style="color:#1589FF">
            <font face="Arial"><b>Different people have their own ways of learning a language. We don’t necessarily have to go to that country to learn a new language. But of course, it’s better if we actually visit a country and speak more of it and learn about their cultures to prevent any culture shock. However, there’s a condition: you have to stay in a rural area where people don’t speak English at all. This is quite tough for a beginner but it’s all about training.</b></font>

        <p style="color:#1589FF">
            <font face="Arial"><b>Aforementioned, Latin is nearly a dead language and so few people speak the language today. As a learner, therefore, I won't recommend people to travel to places that speak Latin because you may not be able to find them anymore. The alternative way for myself to learn it is to learn from Youtube. I know there are pretty good channels that teach Latin. So I may go there and have a look myself.</b></font>
